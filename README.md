3. Developing an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT enabling users to type in the case details which in turn gives you the procedure to handle the case.
   
4. The content management system (CMS) stores details of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court which is later accessed using extensive matching algorithms.
   
5. The website also sends you scheduled emails to follow the case proceedings, notices and case progress.
